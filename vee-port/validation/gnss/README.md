# GNSS Validation

## Overview

This project contains test cases aimed at validating the correct runtime execution 
of the GNSS Pack on a VEE Port connected to a Board Support Package (BSP).
 
Tests are written as JUnit test cases, thus the main entry point is automatically generated by the SDK.

Tests can be launched:

-  as a standard Application by using a local launcher.
-  as a VEE Port Test Suite by building the module.

## Requirements

-  See VEE Port Test Suites [documentation](../README.md).

## Usage

### VEE Port Test Suite Mode

-  Follow the configuration and execution steps described in VEE Port Test Suites [documentation](https://docs.microej.com/en/latest/Tutorials/tutorialRunATestSuiteOnDevice.html).

## Tests Description
